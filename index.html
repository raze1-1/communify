        At Communify, we actively work to unify communities in mobilizing a collective voice. We do this through utilizing technology to support anyone and everyone in need. As long as there is someone to help, Communify has dedicated this website to supporting displaced people across the world.

        Here at Communify, we believe community is key. We have a forum for all users, registered or not, to allow people to access information such as potential housing opportunities, newly opened shelters, work opportunities, and more. It is required that both parties verify their identities and schedule a meeting beforehand to ensure security.
